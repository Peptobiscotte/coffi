# Coffi

Welcome to coffi, a co-working management dashboard webapp I coded to showcase my current progress in learning software development.

First, have a look here [coffi-ten.vercel.app](https://coffi-ten.vercel.app/) 

log in with prefill credentials to access admin mode or with github for user mode.

## Stack

- _typescript_ as the main language,
- _next.js_ the main framework,
- _vite_ is the bundler (and more),
- _nextUI_ for components,
- _tailwind_ for css,
- _mongo_ as the database,
- _aws s3_ for image storage.

## How to Run

Run the development server with

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

ðŸ”Ž _npm_ can be replaced by the tool of your choice (_pnpm_, _yarn_, _bun_, ...)

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deployment

The app is deployed using vercel and reachable here [coffi-ten.vercel.app](https://coffi-ten.vercel.app/)
